# Clodenames 2

Codenames, in Clojure and mostly free of side-effects.

It's a desktop app, when you run it two board windows appear, one for the
spymasters and another for the spies.

When you click on a card on either board, it is revealed!

The game ends when a team reveals all of its spies or when someone reveals the
assassin.
